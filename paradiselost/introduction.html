        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Profit shifting by multinational companies is estimated to impose global revenue losses each year of around $500 billion (Cobham &amp; Janský, 2018) – with the most intense costs in lower-income countries. And the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/">Paradise Papers</a> have confirmed once again the extent to which jurisdictions around the world continue to engage in activities designed to attract profit shifting by multinationals.</p>

<p>Most striking perhaps were the revelations about the search for a new offshore structure for Apple, after it became clear that its Irish arrangement would be shut down. The law firm Baker McKenzie surveyed various local offices of the law firm Appleby, asking them to: “Confirm that an Irish company can conduct management activities (such as board meetings, signing of important contracts) without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction” (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html">Drucker &amp; Bowers, 2017</a>). Jersey ultimately emerged as the ‘winner’ of this race to the bottom, with the losers in effect being any jurisdiction where Apple managed as a result to declare disproportionately low taxable profits in relation to their real economic activity.</p>

<p>The G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, which ran from 2013-2015, was intended to deliver a major reform of the international tax rules for multinational companies. The single aim of the BEPS Action Plan was clear: ‘The G20 finance ministers called on the OECD to develop an action plan to address BEPS issues in a co-ordinated and comprehensive manner. Specifically, this Action Plan should provide countries with domestic and international instruments that will <em>better align rights to tax with economic activity</em>’ (<a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/action-plan-on-base-erosion-and-profit-shifting_9789264202719-en">OECD, 2013 p.11</a>, emphasis added).</p>

<p>The growing consensus that the BEPS project has failed to meet this ambition can be seen not only in the research and media revelations, but also in the policy stance of leading international powers. Although now set aside, the initial proposal for a major US tax reform involved a clean break completely with OECD tax rules and the adoption of a destination-based cashflow tax – a form of unitary taxation that largely eliminates the requirement for transfer pricing adjustments. The EU meanwhile has revived the long-standing proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), which likewise would eliminate transfer pricing by recognising that profit arises at the unit of the multinational group, rather than in individual subsidiaries.</p>

<p>The other key plank of the EU approach to tackling profit shifting has been to turn the pressure on the jurisdictions that promote and benefit from it. This has included the state aid challenges to its own member states that preceded Apple’s Irish restructuring; but also the creation of a blacklist of ‘non-cooperative’ jurisdictions, to target profit shifting procurers outside the EU.</p>

<p>Historically, blacklists have been created by organisations such as the OECD and IMF, without transparent or objectively verifiable criteria (<a href="http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com">Tax Justice Network, 2015</a>). That in turn has left them open to political pressure, and a consistent tendency to identify smaller, less politically well-connected jurisdictions and to omit major financial centres. As such, the G20’s creation in 2009 in London, of a list based on a minimum number of bilateral tax information exchange agreements was an important development. Although the criterion was so weak that the list was empty within days, the principle was established. The Tax Justice Network’s <a href="http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/">Financial Secrecy Index</a> had been created for just this reason, to set objectively verifiable measures of the actual secrecy and potential global impact of jurisdictions, to set a level playing field against which progress could be judged, and so the G20 confirmation of the approach was significant.</p>

<p>The European Council will now bring forward a list concerned not with the wider financial secrecy that underpins offshore tax evasion and wider corruption including the hiding of criminal proceeds, but instead focused on the specific drivers of profit shifting – closer, for example, to the narrower assessment carried out by <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/tax-battles-dangerous-global-race-bottom-corporate-tax">Oxfam’s Tax Battles study</a> (2016) In keeping with the establishment of the principle that objectively verifiable criteria are necessary to ensure a fair and apolitical treatment of jurisdictions, the Council published details of the approach to be taken in advance of conducting investigations of the relevant jurisdictions.</p>

<p>There is, however, considerable concern over the European Council’s approach. This relates to three main issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Substantive basis</strong>.
First, as the following sections will explore, the criteria depend largely on adherence to OECD standards. While this provides external validation that is useful to a point, it also has two problems. For one, it means that non-OECD countries – that is, most lower income countries – are being assessed on their adherence to standards in the design of which they had no meaningful voice. And two, the OECD’s standards are the result of political processes among their (rich country) members – and so often reflect the lowest common denominator for agreement, rather than a more intellectually rigorous or practically valuable analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Objective verifiability</strong>.
The second problem with the European Council’s criteria is that they are not fully objectively verifiable. In fact, the second of the three broad criteria rests entirely on a private assessment conducted by notoriously secretive Code of Conduct on Business Taxation group, using information provided only to this group. As such, external researchers cannot hope to replicate the approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Political limitations</strong>.
Finally, the European Council’s approach suffers from obvious political limitations. The weaknesses of objective verifiability open the door to the same type of political manipulation that characterised earlier lists. Already, it has been leaked that the UK had blocked the notification of 12 out of 53 jurisdictions that they were at risk of blacklisting, relenting only when the launch of the Paradise Papers was imminent. But two bigger issues remain. First, the criteria are drawn in such a way that the United States will escape listing – at least for the first edition. Given the US’ refusal to cooperate with key financial transparency measures, and its position near the top of the Financial Secrecy Index, this is a difficult position to justify. Second, by design the blacklist does not consider EU member states – despite a number of them being commonly identified as among the biggest profit shifting jurisdictions globally. Analysis of US-headquartered multinationals, for which somewhat better data is publicly available, identifies Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland as key players here (Cobham &amp; Janský, 2017) while studies with balance sheet data that is weighted towards European multinationals indicates a role for Austria and Belgium also (Cobham, Janský, &amp; Loretz, 2017)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This report is laid out as follows. The next section sets out the first and third criteria of the European Council, which rest on adherence to OECD standards, and presents our findings for each. The following section presents the more uncertainly specified second criteria, our chosen approach and the results that follow. The subsequent section lays out the implications of applying the approach to EU member states, and a final section concludes with a summary of findings and a set of key questions for policymakers at the European Council and beyond.</p>
